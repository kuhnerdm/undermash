Simple webapp to practice text mashing in Undertale speedruns

In the video game speedrun of Undertale, an important skill to learn is "text mashing", or pressing the Z, X, Enter, and Shift keys in order as fast as possible. This webapp lets runners easily practice their mashing by setting an amount of time to mash, and recording the number of screens of dialogue that would have been skipped in the allotted time.
